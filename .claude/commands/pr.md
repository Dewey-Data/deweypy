Make the title proper title-cased english.

- If this was a feature, do Feature: {Feature Description}
- If this was a bugfix, do Bugfix: {Bugfix}
- If this was something else, just make the test title you can.

Assume the `gh` shell command is available and already connected to the proper GitHub
account. Do `gh --help` if you need more context there.

Extra Context (Highest priority): #$ARGUMENTS
